                <p>Advancements in digital technologies are rapidly transforming
                    the world and in order to sustain in IT industry it is very
                    important to upgrade the technical skills in line with
                    latest developments along with strong programming basics. PG
                    Advanced Secure Software Development (PG-DASSD) course
                    focuses on security requirements for modern software
                    development with equal emphasis on programming foundations
                    to make the students suitable to work in IT industry from
                    day one. In today's scenario, Cyber Security threats are
                    majorly addressed reactively, but by following proper
                    Software Security practices we can minimize the attack
                    surface and address this problem proactively. Therefore
                    Software Security knowledge is the requirement of every
                    Software Engineer. Software Security aspects are built in
                    every module of the course.

                    All the course modules are practical oriented with a focus
                    on foundation as well as advanced concepts. Focus towards
                    building the fundamental concepts of cyber security includes
                    Secure C programming, Data Structures, Operating system
                    internals & Linux programming. Focus on the advanced
                    concepts include Network programming, Cryptography and
                    Network security essentials, Secure Java & Android
                    Programming. The students would also learn Python & Machine
                    Learning and itâ€™s applications in the domain of cyber
                    security. Software Security aspects are built into every
